                <h2>Benefits of regular physical activity.</h2> 
                    <h3>1. Exercise controls weight</h3> 
                    Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
                    <br><br>
                    Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.
                    <br> <hr> <br>
                    
                    <h3>2. Exercise combats health conditions and diseases</h3> 
                    Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your current weight, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol and decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which decreases your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
                    <br><br>
                    Regular exercise helps prevent or manage a wide range of health problems and concerns, including stroke, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, depression, a number of types of cancer, arthritis and falls.
                    <br> <hr> <br>
                    
                    <h3>3. Exercise improves mood</h3> 
                    Need an emotional lift? Or need to blow off some steam after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk 30-minute walk can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier and more relaxed.
                    <br><br>
                    You may also feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.
                    <br> <hr> <br>

                    <h3> 4. Exercise boosts energy</h3>
                    Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
                    <br><br>
                    Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.
                    <br> <hr> <br>

                    <h3>5. Exercise promotes better sleep</h3> 
                    Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to hit the hay.
                    <br> <hr> <br>

                    <h3>6. Exercise puts the spark back into your sex life</h3> 
                    Do you feel too tired or too out of shape to enjoy physical intimacy? Regular physical activity can improve energy levels and physical appearance, which may boost your sex life.
                    <br><br>
                    But there's even more to it than that. Regular physical activity may enhance arousal for women. And men who exercise regularly are less likely to have problems with erectile dysfunction than are men who don't exercise.
                    <br> <hr> <br>

                    <h3>7. Exercise can be fun … and social!</h3> 
                    Exercise and physical activity can be enjoyable. It gives you a chance to unwind, enjoy the outdoors or simply engage in activities that make you happy. Physical activity can also help you connect with family or friends in a fun social setting.
                    <br><br>
                    So, take a dance class, hit the hiking trails or join a soccer team. Find a physical activity you enjoy, and just do it. Bored? Try something new, or do something with friends.
