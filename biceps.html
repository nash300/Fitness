                        <h3>1. Concentration Curls</h3> 
                        Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor.
                        Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.
                        While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
                        Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in.

                        <h3>2. Preacher Curl</h3>
                        To perform this movement you will need a preacher bench and an E-Z bar. Grab the E-Z curl bar at the close inner handle (either have someone hand you the bar which is preferable or grab the bar from the front bar rest provided by most preacher benches). The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar.
                        With the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold the E-Z Curl Bar at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.
                        As you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
                        As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height. Squeeze the biceps hard and hold this position for a second.
                        Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

                        <h3>3. Chin-Up</h3>
                        Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing your torso and a grip closer than the shoulder width.
                        As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible 
                        while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Tip: Keeping the torso
                         as straight as possible maximizes biceps stimulation while minimizing back involvement.
                        As you breathe out, pull your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull-up bar. Concentrate on using the biceps 
                        muscles in order to perform the movement. Keep the elbows close to your body. Tip: The upper torso should remain stationary as 
                        it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
                        After a second of squeezing the biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; when
                         your arms are fully extended. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
